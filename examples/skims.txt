SKIMS — Ultra-Rich Brand Dossier (US + International) *Prepared August 15, 2025 (America/New\_York). All facts verified with public sources; unknowns are labeled as such. Inline citations link to sources, and each section ends with a consolidated source list.* — ## 1 Core Identity & DNA **Narrative** SKIMS is a solutions-oriented underwear, shapewear, loungewear, swim and basics brand co-created by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede in 2019, with Emma Grede cited as a founding partner in many references. The company’s identity centers on inclusive fits, tones and sizing and a product philosophy of practical, comfort-led “solutions.” Press consistently repeats the brand’s tagline, **“Solutions For Every Body,”** which appears in mainstream coverage of SKIMS campaigns. The founding story includes a pivotal early rebrand: after announcing the name “Kimono” in 2019, Kardashian faced cultural-appropriation criticism and changed the brand’s name to SKIMS, publicly acknowledging the feedback. ([Trustpilot][1]) The voice and style are clean, body-positive and utility-forward. Site copy foregrounds “guides,” “solutions,” and compression levels (“Light, Mid, Strong, Extra Strong”)—functional language that reinforces the solutions ethos, while color names (Onyx, Sand, Cocoa, Mica, Sienna, Jasper, etc.) underscore a neutral, shade-inclusive palette. Distinctive brand assets are anchored in: a minimalist wordmark (official typography not publicly specified), a core neutral palette echoed in product colorways, an emphasis on tonal campaign imagery, and athlete-led creative (Neymar Jr., Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nick Bosa) since the 2023 men’s launch. “A football legend meets a fashion legend for 2023’s most viral campaign,” GQ wrote of Neymar’s debut. A defining cultural anchor is sport: in October 2023 SKIMS became the *official underwear partner* of the NBA, WNBA and USA Basketball—cementing a brand identity that mixes pop-cultural star power with athletic credibility. **Quote:** “making SKIMS the official underwear partner of the NBA, the WNBA and USA Basketball.” **Discrete facts (≥5)** * Founded in 2019 by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede (with Emma Grede referenced as a founding partner). * Tagline/ethos widely quoted as “Solutions For Every Body.” * Early name “Kimono” was changed to SKIMS following criticism in 2019.

Trustpilot includes numerous 5-star notes on fabric feel and fit alongside complaints about delays/returns and inconsistent tracking. **Positive quote (≤25 words):** “I absolutely love the feeling of skims dipped cotton… bras are… very comfortable fabric!” (Aug 2025). **Negative quote (≤25 words):** “Tried 6 different bras… None… worked for me. Customer service… was a nightmare.” (Aug 2025). **Press tone.** Sampling recent mainstream items (Reuters funding context; GQ features; NBA/WNBA league announcements; People campaign) shows largely positive/celebratory or neutral business coverage. **Approximate breakdown (editorial sample, Oct 2023–May 2025):** \~80% positive (campaign/partnership features), \~20% neutral (valuation/funding context), \~0% negative (in this sample). *Inference based on the cited pieces.* **Customer-care signals.** BBB shows **A+ accreditation** for SKIMS’ Culver City entity, with active complaint resolution logs (2025). Additional BBB listings exist for retail locations (e.g., Austin) that are *not* accredited—useful nuance for shoppers. **Sentiment contours (social/communities).** Reddit forums reveal polarized experiences—some endorse shapewear quality/comfort, others criticize price/quality variability and service. **Discrete facts (≥5)** * Trustpilot includes positive fabric/fit reviews and negative service/returns complaints (Aug 2025 snapshots). * BBB profile lists SKIMS (Culver City) as **A+ accredited** since 2019. * Additional BBB listing (Austin store) “not accredited,” illustrating fragmented listings by location. * PissedConsumer aggregates a low average (1.8/5) with “customer service” as a common pain point. * Reddit threads show both praise for shapewear’s comfort and criticism of clothing quality. * Press items around partnerships/campaigns are largely positive; funding news neutral. *Methodological inference from cited articles.* **Sources (Section 5)** * [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skims.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skims.com) * [https://ca.trustpilot.com/review/skims.com?page=3](https://ca.trustpilot.com/review/skims.com?page=3) * [https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/culver-city/profile/womens-clothing/skims-1216-1265584](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/culver-city/profile/womens-clothing/skims-1216-1265584) * [https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/culver-city/profile/womens-clothing/skims-1216-1265584/complaints](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/culver-city/profile/womens-clothing/skims-1216-1265584/complaints) * [https://www.bbb.org/us/tx/austin/profile/retail-stores/skims-0825-1000231761](https://www.bbb.org/us/tx/austin/profile/retail-stores/skims-0825-1000231761) * [https://skims.pissedconsumer.com/review.html](https://skims.pissedconsumer.com/review.html) * [https://www.reddit.com/r/SKIMSbyKKW/comments/119wse3/is\_skims\_worth\_the\_money\_i\_want\_to\_buy\_a\_few\_bits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SKIMSbyKKW/comments/119wse3/is_skims_worth_the_money_i_want_to_buy_a_few_bits/) * [https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/wellington-talks-invest-kim-kardashians-skims-4-bln-valuation-sources-2023-07-12/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/wellington-talks-invest-kim-kardashians-skims-4-bln-valuation-sources-2023-07-12/) * [https://www.nba.com/news/skims-underwear-partner-nba-wnba-usab-official-release](https://www.nba.com/news/skims-underwear-partner-nba-wnba-usab-official-release) --- ## 6 Competitive Landscape **Narrative** **Direct competitors:** * **Spanx** — the legacy shapewear leader;

AEO reports strong Aerie growth in 2024/2025, signalling robust demand. * **Victoria’s Secret** — broader lingerie/fashion brand and a high-traffic rival domain. **Share of voice & digital presence:** Similarweb shows **skims.com ≈8.4M visits (July 2025)** vs. **spanx.com ≈2.3M**, and lists victoriassecret.com among SKIMS’ closest web competitors, indicating SKIMS’ strong DTC share of voice. **Quote:** “skims.com’s web traffic has increased by 1.86% compared to last month.” **Innovation radar (recent):** * Athlete-fronted **men’s** line creative (2023) by SKIMS reset category storytelling toward sport. * **League partnerships** (NBA/WNBA/USAB) extend into events and digital signage. * Category collabs like **Roberto Cavalli x SKIMS** in swim refresh visual identity and price architecture. **Discrete facts (≥5)** * Spanx majority stake acquired by Blackstone at **\$1.2B** (2021). * Honeylove funding totaled **\~\$16M** by 2022 reports. * YITTY launched Apr 12, 2022 via Fabletics (XS–6X; recycled fibers). * SKIMS site traffic ≈8.4M vs spanx.com ≈2.3M (Jul 2025). * Victoria’s Secret is a top competitor domain by similarity and volume. * SKIMS’ sports-driven innovation (NBA partnership) differentiates category cues. **Sources (Section 6)** * [https://www.reuters.com/business/blackstone-buys-majority-stake-shapewear-maker-spanx-2021-10-20/](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackstone-buys-majority-stake-shapewear-maker-spanx-2021-10-20/) * [https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylrobinson/2022/04/13/how-a-300-thousand-kickstarter-turned-into-a-13-million-series-a-funding-round-for-honeylove/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylrobinson/2022/04/13/how-a-300-thousand-kickstarter-turned-into-a-13-million-series-a-funding-round-for-honeylove/) * [https://yitty.fabletics.com/](https://yitty.fabletics.com/) * [https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/shapewear-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/shapewear-market) * [https://www.similarweb.com/website/skims.com/vs/spanx.com/](https://www.similarweb.com/website/skims.com/vs/spanx.com/) * [https://www.similarweb.com/website/skims.com/competitors/](https://www.similarweb.com/website/skims.com/competitors/) * [https://www.gq.com/story/skims-mens-launch-kim-kardashian-interview](https://www.gq.com/story/skims-mens-launch-kim-kardashian-interview) * [https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kim-kardashian-skims-official-underwear-partner-of-nba](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kim-kardashian-skims-official-underwear-partner-of-nba) --- ## 7 Vertical & Macro Context **Narrative** The global **shapewear market** was **\$2.73B in 2024** and is projected to reach **\$4.32B by 2030** (CAGR **8.0%** from 2025–2030) per Grand View Research. **Quote:** “projected to reach USD 4.32 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.0%.” Drivers include fabric innovation and social media’s fashion influence—tailwinds that align with SKIMS’ content-driven commerce and material R\&D. US intimates/comfort leaders (e.g., Aerie) continue to report outsized growth, indicating durable demand for comfort-first basics that blur innerwear/outerwear—a category seam SKIMS exploits with Soft Lounge dresses and ribbed loungewear. Culturally, **body-inclusivity** and **sports x fashion** convergence (athletes in underwear campaigns; league partnerships) are dominant aesthetics in the 2020s, and SKIMS sits at their intersection. Regulatory macro risks appear low; supply-chain and logistics remain evergreen execution risks (mirrored in consumer feedback on shipping/returns). **Risks & opportunities.** * **Risks:** Customer-service volatility (shipping/returns), quality perception gaps in certain apparel lines, and reputational exposure from celebrity-led brands. * **Opportunities:** Global category growth; men’s basics expansion; sport/event merchandising; premium designer capsules to elevate AOV (e.g., Cavalli). **Discrete facts (≥5)** * Global shapewear market: **\$2.73B (2024)** → **\$4.32B (2030)**, **8.0% CAGR**. * Growth drivers cited: fabric tech, social media influence, lifestyle shifts. * Aerie reported strong growth within AEO’s 2024/25 results, signaling category momentum. * Sports partnerships are mainstream (SKIMS x NBA/WNBA/USAB). * Logistics/returns complaints persist as a consumer risk factor (BBB logs; reviews). **Sources (Section 7)** * [https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/shapewear-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/shapewear-market) * [https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-shapewear-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-shapewear-market) * [https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/retail/aeo-nets-moderate-sales-as-aerie-continues-to-grow/](https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/retail/aeo-nets-moderate-sales-as-aerie-continues-to-grow/) * [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/skims-named-official-underwear-partner-of-the-nba-wnba-and-usa-basketball-301971414.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/skims-named-official-underwear-partner-of-the-nba-wnba-and-usa-basketball-301971414.html) * [https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/culver-city/profile/womens-clothing/skims-1216-1265584/complaints](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/culver-city/profile/womens-clothing/skims-1216-1265584/complaints) --- ## 8 Public Performance Signals **Narrative** **Engagement velocity (owned web).** Similarweb estimates **\~8.4M visits** to skims.com in **July 2025**, **+1.86% MoM**, with **61%** of traffic from the US and meaningful shares from the UK, Australia, Canada and Germany—evidence of an international footprint. **Quote:** “skims.com’s web traffic has increased by 1.86% compared to last month.” **Top-performing public creative (indicative).** * **Men’s launch (Oct 2023)** starring Neymar Jr., Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nick Bosa generated widespread coverage and social buzz. * **League partnership (Oct 2023)** amplified reach via NBA/WNBA/USAB channels and event signage. * **Roberto Cavalli x SKIMS Swim (2025)** brought designer cachet (new prints/prices) to the swim category. **Investment indicators.** * **Valuation context:** Reuters reported SKIMS was in talks in 2023 for funding at a **\$4B valuation**, with **\$500M revenue in 2022** and profitability—signaling strong investor appetite.
